# Pricing Plans Project

## Overview
This project is a responsive pricing page featuring three plans: **Basic**, **Pro**, and **Premium**. The **Pro** plan is highlighted as the most popular option. The page is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and JavaScript (for initializing icons using Lucide). It demonstrates a clean, semantic structure, responsive design, and smooth hover animations.

## How to Run the Project

### Locally
1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**

   - **Clone via Git (recommended):**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/DevMohamedd/Interactive-Pricing-Table.git
     ```
   - **Or Download as a ZIP:**  
     Download the ZIP file from GitHub, extract it, and navigate into the project folder.

2. **Open the Project:**

   - **Option A: Open Directly in a Browser**  
     Locate the `index.html` file in the project folder and open it in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).  
     *Note:* Some features might not work properly if run directly from the file system due to browser security restrictions.

   - **Option B: Run via a Local Server**  
     For full functionality and to avoid any potential issues with local file restrictions, open your terminal in the project folder and run:
     ```bash
     npx serve
     ```
     This command will start a local server, and you'll receive a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`) that you can open in your browser to view the project.

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop View:** The pricing cards are displayed in a three-column grid.
- **Mobile View:** On screens below 600px, the pricing cards stack vertically to ensure a user-friendly mobile experience.

## Design Decisions
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  Used for rapid development, utility-first styling, and built-in responsive design classes.
  
- **Lucide Icons:**  
  Included via CDN to render check icons in the feature lists.
  
- **Interactivity & Hover Effects:**  
  Smooth transitions and subtle animations (e.g., shadow changes and translations) are applied to cards and buttons to enhance user interactivity.
  
- **Semantic HTML:**  
  The code uses a clear and semantic HTML structure, improving both accessibility and SEO.

## Customization and Future Enhancements
- **Additional Styling:**  
  You can add custom styles by creating a separate CSS file if further customization is needed.
  
- **JavaScript Enhancements:**  
  Additional interactivity or animations can be implemented by adding a separate JavaScript file and linking it in `index.html`.
